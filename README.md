## UBC Course Scheduler

This course scheduler will schedule UBC courses according to user preferences, 
using a rule-based scoring system to generate optimized schedules. Users will be 
able to search for and select courses, read course descriptions, set time 
preferences, and choose preferred course sections. The scheduler will visualize 
the result in a calendar.

All UBC students who don't need STT courses can use this scheduler to make their
course registration experience slightly less stressful.

Throughout my (very short) time at UBC, the most stressful
thing I have experienced so far is not a final or group presentation, but 
course registration. Watching the last spot in a lecture get taken while
waiting for your registration time to open and then having to redo half the schedule 
is not very fun. This is why I want to create a course scheduler which will not 
only reduce the stress and time of manually scheduling courses, but also 
optimize the courses, which would be difficult to do by hand.
